  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Hi, I'm Sanjeev, a software developer</h1>
  <p class="mt-4">
    My relationship with computers started when i was 8 years old. I was in
    grade 2. This was the first time i had "Computer" as one of the dedicated
    subjects in the school curriculum. We used to have alternate days for
    studying text book and going to computer lab. I had seen a computer before
    but never really got the chance to play with it. I started spending hours
    playing with programs like Ms-Paint, Ms-word and games like MsHearts,
    Spider, Pin ball, etc, classic Windows XP era games. My love for video games
    led me to discovering a game called "Dangerous Dave". You can actually play
    it in <a

    >
      browser now.</a
    > I loved the game so much, i argued with my father to get me a personal computer
    just so i can play it at home. I found out that people who build such games are
    called Software Engineers. At that time, I had made my mind that i will grow
    up to become a Software Engineer.

    Fast forward 10 years later, I had to choose a college for my bachelors. My
    hometown didn't have a good college that taught coding. I moved to Kathmandu
    (Nepal's capital) and joined a college to study Computer Science. 3 years
    into my college, and i had completed 3 internships and started a full time
    job.

      I built a comprehensive time-tracking application using React and

      hundreds of dollars per month by eliminating the need of currently used
      third party solution. I worked closely with the employees to understand
      the most used features of the existing solution and built a solution that
      met their requirements.

      I implemented CI/CD pipelines, Dockerfile configurations, and executed
      production deployments for integrating an AI-powered chatbot into the
      company's website. I assisted in resolving deployment-related issues, SSH
      configuration, Docker utilization, and database management for an
      e-commerce PHP application from start to finish. I leveraged multiple AWS
      services including EC2 instances, load balancers, auto-scaling, and
      CloudFormation to deploy scalable applications across multiple projects,
      and developed Terraform scripts to provision infrastructure on AWS
      promoting reusability and maintainability. At the end of my internship, I
      gave a short Kubernetes training session to the entire tech team
      comprising over 30 members, facilitating their understanding and adoption
      of containerization and orchestration technologies.
